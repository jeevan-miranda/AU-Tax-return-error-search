# Sprint-6-project
AU Tax return error searchable database

# Idea:
Searchable database using JS to search for Tax return error code descriptions and answers 

# Problem:
In Xero Tax AU, there are a number of tax return error codes specified by the ATO that are not currently documented on the ATO website or in Xero’s internal knowledge articles or external support content.

This leads agents to spend increased amounts of time investigating the cause of errors, e.g combing through past cases, waiting for senior support etc, which results in longer time to resolution for customer queries.

# Solution:
A searchable database of the ATO error codes and a short descriptor of the resolution can reduce time spent by agents in investigating cases, leading to faster outcomes for our customers and increased KPI efficiency.

# Limitations:
The data to be included in the database is limited to a list of codes I’ve compiled in Excel over my time working in the AU Tax queue.
This means that the list of codes will be limited, and the solutions suggested will be relative to the time period in which they were collated. E.g if ATO tax return labels are updated this can mean the solutions may become outdated.

# Stretch:
Build a CSV importer to allow users to add new error codes to JSON.
